## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Clear Content

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

[Intro paragraph TBD].

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* write text using as much concise and straightforward language as possible to make the content easier to understand and process
* employ active voice and address the reader directly when possible
* collaborate with designer's and developers to provide easy to read font types 

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Show examples of text passages with clear, easy to understand, and easy to read language. Compare those with passages that do not meet these requirements. Emphasize that clear and easy to understand  passages are essential for people with disabilities and benefit all. 
* Demonstrate use of active versus passive voice in sentence structures. Explain how addressing the reader directly and identifying the person or thing carrying the action helps several groups of people with disabilities understand the content easier. Emphasize how this improves the ability of several groups of people with disabilities to understand text.
* Demonstrate approaches to group related content for easier processing and readability. For example, appropriate spacing between different content sections and use of paragraphs and lists to group related content.
* Demonstrate how different font types and sizes impact readability of the content. Demonstrate use of font types, such as Sans Serif

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to assess knowledge:

[TBD]

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Terminology

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

[Intro paragraph TBD].

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* utilize words that are easy to understand for the target audience(s)
* provide the extended form of:
  * abbreviations
  * acronyms
* provide explanations for complex terms and jargon

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Demonstrate how to provide the extended form for abbreviations and acronyms. For example, including the extensions just after the abbreviation and acronym the first time they appear in the document.
* Reflect with students about terms that are difficult to understand, including jargon and terms that require advanced reading ability. Demonstrate how to provide substitutions for those terms when possible. Explain how to provide explanations when they cannot be changed, for example including a glossary of terms in the document.

[TBD]

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to assess knowledge:

* Practical &mdash; Give students a piece of text with terms that are difficult to understand. Ask them to either provide an explanation for such terms or to substitute them with terms that are easier. 
{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Link Text

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Intro paragraph [TBD].

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* write unique, descriptive, and meaningful link text
* provide relevant information about the link destination in the link text where possible, including:
  * the target resource title
  * if the link will open a new window
  * the file type and format (when linking to a file)
* collaborate with designers and developers to ensure visual and non-visual perception of links and their different states
* employ accessible authoring tools that:
  * allow the inclusion of additional information for links where needed
  * produce appropriate markup for links

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Discuss different uses of links, such as for linking to other pages, to a document, or to different parts of the content. Explain that these links must have clear and meaningful text so that people can understand their purpose as well as where they go to. For example, providing  information about the link destination, the document type and format, and where the link will open.
* Show examples of some predefined styles for links and link states. Explain that redefining the styles is a designer's and author tool vendor's responsibility. If the author changes these styles, they must ensure they are accessible.
* Introduce accessible authoring tools that produce appropriate markup for links and that support the inclusion of additional information for links where needed. Explain that some tools may refer to additional information in different ways. For example, "link description", "screen tip", and others. Explain that it is good practice to always display as much information as possible on the screen's link text to maximize compatibility with user agents and assistive technologies. Explain that some tools may produce accessible content but may not be accessible themselves and vice versa.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to assess knowledge:

* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Ask students which types of information the link text could contain. Assess how students relate the information that the link text could contain, including link destination, document type and format, and where the link will open.
* Practical &mdash; Give students a link text that is not meaningful and ask them to make it meaningful by tweaking its language. Assess how students provide meaningful and descriptive link text.

## Teaching Resources

Suggested resources to support your teaching:

* [Writing for Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/writing/#use-headings-to-convey-meaning-and-structure) -- Introduces some basic considerations to help you get started writing web content that is more accessible to people with disabilities.
* [[How People with Disabilities Use the Web]](/people-use-web/) &mdash; Describes some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies that some people use.
* [Understandable Content (Web Accessibility Perspective)](/perspective-videos/understandable/) &mdash; Is one of the Web accessibility perspectives videos that show accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities.
* [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) &mdash; Address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.
