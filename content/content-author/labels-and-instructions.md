Courses based on this module should:

[TBD]

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how people with disabilities rely on clear and meaningful labels and instructions to understand and interact with web pages and applications
* provide clear and meaningful textual and visual labels for controls that help users understand their purpose
* provide textual and visual instructions that describe the overall purpose and intent of the content
* provide instructions about the current step and about the total number of steps in a multi-step process
* collaborate with designers and developers to provide:
  * instructions about expected input types and formats
  * error messages that identify the field in error
  * suggestions for correction when possible based on the selected input formats and validation methods
* identify related requirements for designers and developers to make labels and instructions perceivable both visually and non-visually

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:

{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Labels

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

[Intro paragraph TBD].

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* explain how people with disabilities rely on clear and meaningful labels to identify and understand the purpose of forms and controls
* provide unique and descriptive labels for controls
* ensure labels are perceived both visually and non-visually
* employ accessible authoring tools that:
  * support the inclusion of labels for controls
  * programmatically associate labels to their corresponding control

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Demonstrate assistive technology interaction with controls, including form fields, links, and buttons. Explain that providing labels that describe the purpose of the controls is essential for several groups of users.
* Reflect with students about commonly used labels for form fields and controls, including "name", "surname", "address", "phone", "email", and others. Explain that the label should be a short, succinct, and straightforward text that communicates the purpose and intent of the control.
* refer back to [Content Author Module 1: Content Clarity](/curricula/content-author-modules/content-clarity). Explain that some users need to have imagery and iconography to make it easier for them to understand the purpose of these labels.
* Introduce accessible authoring tools that support the inclusion of labels for forms and controls and that programmatically associate these to the control.  Explain that content authors should provide these labels and ensure the tool associates this to their corresponding control.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to assess knowledge:

* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Ask students about the type of information that labels should contain. Assess how students understand what is the type of information  that labels should contain.
* Practical &mdash; Give students several controls without a label and ask them to provide one for each. Assess how students provide short, succinct, and straightforward labels for controls.
* Practical &mdash; Have students include labels for controls in a tool of their choice that programmatically associates the labels with their corresponding control. Assess how students use an authoring tool of their choice to include labels for controls.

### Topic: Instructions

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

[Intro paragraph TBD].

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* explain how people with disabilities rely on clear instructions to understand the content and to provide accurate input when required
* provide clear instructions about the overall purpose of the content
* write additional instructions for controls that communicate the information that the user should provide
* include instructions about the current step and about the total number of steps in a multi-step process
* ensure instructions are perceived both visually and non-visually
* employ accessible authoring tools that:
  * support the inclusion of instructions for overall content and for specific parts of the content
  * programmatically associate instructions to their corresponding control
