## Introduction
{:.no-display}

Courses based on this module should:

* demonstrate how people with disabilities rely on alternatives to multimedia content, including description of visual information (also known as audio description, video description, or described video), captions, (also known as subtitles), transcripts, and sign language(s), to understand information contained in audio and video content
* explain accessibility requirements for planning and including alternatives to audio and video content

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how people with disabilities rely on alternatives to multimedia content, including description of visual information, captions/subtitles, transcripts, and sign languages, to understand information contained in audio and video content
* consider the below before creating audio and video content:
  * as much redundant visual and audio content as possible to help different groups of users understand the content
  * clear and easy to understand speech
  * minimized background audio and overall distractions where possible
* ensure multimedia content includes alternatives to audio and video content based on content type and format, including:
  * captions (to help users who cannot hear the audio get the information)
  * description of visual information
  * transcripts (to help people who cannot hear the audio or see the visuals get the information)
  * sign languages (for people whose first language is a sign language)
* create video content that avoids flashing entirely or only flashes below the acceptable thresholds
* employ accessible authoring tools that support including and controlling alternatives to audio and video content
* identify related requirements for designers and developers to support visual and non-visual perception and operation of:
  * alternatives to multimedia content 
  * media player controls

### Topic: Planning Audio and Video

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

[Intro paragraph TBD].

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* plan for the inclusion of the following when creating new audio and video content:
  * sufficient contrast ratio for text in the video to enhance readability of the text
  * audio with as low background as possible to help distinguish foreground from background audio
  * clear audio, language, and speech to help users better understand the content
  * speaker visibility (including for lip reading and sign language interpretation)
* create video content that does not flash more than three times in any one second
* inform users when not providing one or more alternatives to multimedia content to avoid confusion
