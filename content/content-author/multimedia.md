## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how people with disabilities rely on alternatives to multimedia content (including description of visual information, captions, transcripts, and sign language) to understand information contained in audio and video content

  * clear and easy to understand speech
  * minimized background audio and overall distractions where possible
  * visual and audio content that complements each other where possible
* ensure  multimedia content includes alternatives to audio and video content based on content type and format, including:

  * description of visual information
  * transcripts (to help people who cannot hear the audio or see the visuals get the information)
  * sign language (for people whose first language is sign language)
* create video content that avoids flashing entirely or only flashes below the acceptable thresholds
* employ accessible authoring tools that support including and controlling alternatives to audio and video content
* identify related requirements for designers and developers to support visual and non-visual perception and operation of:
  * alternatives to multimedia content
