## Introduction
{:.no-display}

Courses based on this module should:

* demonstrate how people with disabilities rely on headings, paragraphs, lists, and other structures to understand, navigate, and process content
* explain accessibility requirements related to content structure

## Learning Outcomes for Module

Students should be able to:

* explain how people with disabilities rely on headings, paragraphs, lists, and other structures to understand, navigate and process content
* provide headings to help users identify the different content sections
* employ accessible authoring tools that:
  * support the inclusion of headings, lists, paragraphs, and other content structures
  * produce appropriate markup for headings, lists, paragraphs, and other content structures
* collaborate with developers and designers to ensure visual and non-visual perception of content structures , including headings, paragraphs, lists, quotes, and others

## Topics to Teach

Topics to achieve the learning outcomes:


{% include excol.html type="start" %}

### Topic: Headings

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

[Intro paragraph TBD].

#### Learning Outcomes for Topic

Students should be able to:

* provide headings and their corresponding rank levels to help users identify the different content sections and sub sections
* write descriptive and meaningful heading text depending on the heading purpose
* collaborate with designers and developers to ensure visual and non-visual perception of headings
* employ accessible authoring tools that produce appropriate markup for headings and their corresponding rank levels

#### Teaching Ideas for Topic

Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes:

* Discuss different ways of structuring pages and documents. Explain how these structures relate to headings in the content. Discuss headings and their corresponding rank levels. Explain that it is good practice to use heading level one for including the information of the page title. Some tools automate this process, some require the author to do it manually. 
* Explain some uses of heading text. These include entitling a given section, providing a headline for a piece of news, and summarizing the content the heading precedes.
* Show examples of how headings may appear visually. Explain that predefining the styles is a designer's and author tool vendor's responsibility. If the author changes these styles, they must ensure they are accessible.
* Introduce accessible authoring tools that produce appropriate markup for headings. Explain that changing the font size alone does not produce an accessible heading. It is more efficient to rely on the tool's built-in functionality and then change the style later. Explain that some tools may produce accessible content but may not be accessible themselves and vice versa.

#### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic

Optional ideas to assess knowledge:

* Short Answer Questions &mdash; Ask students about situations where they would use headings. Assess how students identify situations where headings can be used.
* Practical &mdash; Give students several page headings and ask them to use accessible styles. Assess how students employ accessible styles for headings.
* Practical &mdash; Have students include headings using a given authoring tool. Assess how students rely on the tool's built-in functionality to include headings.

{% include excol.html type="all" %}

## Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module

Optional ideas to assess knowledge:

* Portfolio &mdash; Have students create a page with accessible content structures, including headings, links, paragraphs, and lists. Assess how students include accessible headings, links, paragraphs, and lists in their pages.

## Teaching Resources

Suggested resources to support your teaching:

* [Writing for Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/writing/#use-headings-to-convey-meaning-and-structure) -- Introduces some basic considerations to help you get started writing web content that is more accessible to people with disabilities.
* [[How People with Disabilities Use the Web]](/people-use-web/) &mdash; Describes some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies that some people use.
* [Understandable Content (Web Accessibility Perspective)](/perspective-videos/understandable/) &mdash; Is one of the Web accessibility perspectives videos that show accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities.
* [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) &mdash; Address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.
